life too unbelievable~  
building unknown technologies for the underground ...

Mainly technologies:  
| - | EKG, a GPU-accelerated GUI toolkit multi-platform for C++.  
| - | Voke, a lightweight C/C++ library-manager cross-platform (mainly Windows focused).  
| - | Bicudo, a GPU-accelerated physics engine.
